# Contact-Book-in-Python


This is a simple Python program to manage a phone book. It allows users to add contacts, search for contacts, and display all contacts.

## Features

- **Add a Contact**: Users can add a new contact by providing a name and phone number. Optionally, they can also input the country name to automatically initialize the country code.
- **Search for a Contact**: Users can search for a contact by name and view their phone number.
- **Show All Contacts**: Users can view all saved contacts.
- **Exit**: Users can choose to exit the program.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Run the `phone_book.py` file.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various actions like adding a contact, searching for a contact, or showing all contacts.
3. Optionally input the country name when adding a contact to automatically initialize the country code.

## Assumptions

- Phone numbers are assumed to be 10 digits long.
- Country codes are automatically initialized based on the user input (optional). Default country code is set to +91 (India) if not provided.

## Future Improvements

- Implement better error handling and validation for user inputs.
- Add support for additional functionalities such as updating and deleting contacts.
- Improve the detection of country codes for phone numbers.
